    "# Homework: IoT Data Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will work in groups to simulate IoT data as the first step toward building a smart tracking system. This will help you understand how IoT devices collect and process real-world data, which is essential for building smart tracking systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to process and analyze IoT-generated data is crucial in many real-life applications. In smart logistics, companies like Amazon and FedEx use IoT sensors to track shipments and monitor environmental conditions to ensure product quality. In healthcare, wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers continuously monitor heart rate, oxygen levels, and activity, providing real-time health data for better patient care. Likewise, in environmental monitoring, smart sensors track air quality and pollution levels, helping cities make informed decisions to improve public health and sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This task will be especially helpful in providing hands-on experience with IoT data simulation, giving you a clearer understanding of its role in different real-world applications. Through this exercise, you will learn the significance of data collection, interpretation, and analysis—skills that are essential for careers in technology, data science, logistics, and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions below: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Meet with your group mates.\n",
    "    1.1 Create a space where you can discuss your plans (e.g., your section’s group chat or a group chat that you create specifically for this task). \n",
    "    1.2. Agree on the date and time to complete the task. \n",
    "    1.3. Create a new GitHub repository and start using it for your projects.\n",
    "        a. Go to GitHub\n",
    "        b. Click Sign Up (if you don’t have an account) or Sign In (if you already have one).\n",
    "        c. Complete the sign-up process, verifying your email if required.\n",
    "        d. Once logged in, click on the “+” icon in the top-right corner.\n",
    "        e. Select “New repository” from the dropdown.\n",
    "        f. Fill in the repository details:\n",
    "        g. Repository Name: Choose a name for your project (e.g., IoT-Data-Simulation).\n",
    "            i. Description (Optional): Provide a summary of the repository.\n",
    "            ii. Public or Private: Choose Public if you want others to see your work or Private if you want to keep it restricted.\n",
    "            iii. Initialize with a README: Check this box to create an initial README.md file.\n",
    "        h. Click \"Create Repository\".\n",
    "        i. To invite collaborators, go to your repository’s Settings → Collaborators and add their GitHub usernames.\n",
    "2. Open Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "3. Install necessary Python libraries if not already installed. \n",
    "4. Choose what kind of data your IoT system should generate. Click the output name in your sign-up sheet to see your choices.\n",
    "5. Write a Python script to generate your IoT data. Here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sA-A4mBo3oNfBMz1FhjSu-WTBmNobknb3EPdU4oPejs/edit?tab=t.0) is a general template. Modify it depending on your chosen industry and data.\n",
    "6. Execute the script in the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "7. Confirm that the generated dataset looks correct.\n",
    "8. Save your simulated data as a CSV file (e.g., iot_data.csv). Upload it to your GitHub repository.\n",
    "9. Follow the naming convention: MO-IT148 Homework: IoT Data Simulation <Section> <Group Name> E.g., MO-IT148 Homework: IoT  Data Simulation A1101 Group One.\n",
    "10. Save your work to your MMDC Drive. \n",
    "11. Make sure your file’s share settings have been updated so that anyone from MMDC can comment. \n",
    "12. Copy the link to your output and paste it as your submission. \n",
